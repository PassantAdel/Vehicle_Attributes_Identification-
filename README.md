# Vehicle_Attributes_Identification-
This project focuses on the identification of five essential attributes of any vehicle: type, color, damage status, speed, and license plate number. Leveraging the power of computer vision and machine learning, we have implemented YOLOv8 to achieve accurate and real-time attribute recognition.

# Key Features
Attribute Recognition: Our model can recognize and classify various vehicle attributes.
Real-time Processing: The system processes video or image input in real-time, making it suitable for both static images and dynamic scenarios.
YOLOv8 Integration: We employ YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection framework, to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in attribute recognition.
Multi-attribute Recognition: The model simultaneously identifies multiple attributes, providing comprehensive information about the observed vehicle.

# How it Works
Data Collection: We collected a diverse dataset of vehicles, including different types, colors, damage statuses, speeds, and license plate variations.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent preprocessing to ensure high-quality training data.
Training: We trained the YOLOv8 model using the preprocessed dataset.
Real-time Inference: The trained model is integrated into our system to perform real-time attribute recognition.
User Interface: The user interacts with the system through an easy-to-use interface, providing images or video feeds for analysis.
Display Results: The system displays the recognized attributes for each detected vehicle, providing valuable information to the user.
