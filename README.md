# Vehicle_Attributes_Identification-
This project focuses on the identification of five essential attributes of any vehicle: type, color, damage status, speed, and license plate number. Leveraging the power of computer vision and machine learning, we have implemented YOLOv8 to achieve accurate and real-time attribute recognition.
